          <h4>Present</h4>
          <p>I’m currently working on developing a new career as a web developer. I have used my time learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery, using online resources, including Codecademy. I’m gaining more experience and knowledge all the time and I’m also able to keep an eye on other new codes and trends that are becoming in-demand.<br /><br />

          Why did I change? I needed a fresh challenge and the opportunity to learn and develop new skills really appealed to me. I love that I can build websites from scratch, there is also a problem solving aspect, which I enjoy when I working through my projects and review existing websites to understand the code and develop fixes.<br /><br />

          I started out learning code as hobby and as I learned it was a very powerful tool that allowed me to create new websites and designs.<br /><br />

          I’m married, to a very understanding wide and and a father of a gorgeous and cheeky daughter.<br /><br />
          </p>
          <h4>Past</h4>
          <p>In the autumn of 2017 after sixteen years working for one of the City’s Asset Management firms, I left my last role as HR Reward and MI Manager.<br /><br />Having been there since graduating from college I had been given opportunities to grow and develop within the Human Resources team. I started as a relatively inexperienced HR systems administrator before moving into through HR consultant roles. I was then able to utilise my systems and technical skills to progress into technical HR roles covering HR Projects, which included number of acquisitions. This then evolved into a HR System and Management Information management role, which then lead into working in HR Reward (Remuneration).<br /><br />Whilst I had enjoyed my time in HR, the timing of my departure was fortuitous as I had started to consider a career change as I was missing the opportunity to develop new skills and experiences.<br /><br />I studied Architecture to degree level at University.
          </p>
          <h4>Future</h4>
          <p>I’m looking forward to what it may bring.
