          <h4>Present</h4>
          <p>
            I’m currently developing a new career as a web developer, after leaving my previous role as HR Manager for an Asset Management firm for 16 years. I have used my time to learn various codes including: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery, using books and online resources, including Codecademy. I’m gaining more experience and knowledge all the time and I’m also able to keep an eye on other new codes and trends that are becoming in-demand.<br/><br/>

            Why did I change? I needed a fresh challenge and the opportunity to learn and develop new skills really appealed to me. I love that I can build websites from scratch. There is also a problem solving aspect, which I enjoy when I working through my projects and reviewing existing websites to understand the code and develop alterations and fixes. I'm also excited to meet new people and clients.<br/><br/>

            I started out learning code as hobby and as I learned it was a very powerful tool that allowed me to create new websites and designs.<br/><br/>

            I’m married, to a very understanding and supportive wife and and a father to a gorgeous, and sometimes cheeky, daughter.<br/><br/>

            I enjoy cycling, particularly Mountain biking, and like the challenge of long-distance rides. I once cycled from London to Paris in 24hrs and rode in the first London Ride 100 event.<br/><br/>

            I enjoy running and often combine it with a love of landscape photography (see <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ross.worby/">Instagram</a>).<br/><br/>

            I’m a keen cook and enjoy trying new recipes and then seeing how I can add to them.<br/><br/>

            I’d like to be a better gardener, but I am satisfied that not everything I plant-out dies.<br/><br/>

            Even prior to becoming a web developer I also love technology and gadgets.

          <h4>Past</h4>
          <p>In the autumn of 2017 after sixteen years working for one of the City’s Asset Management firms, I left my last role as HR Reward and MI Manager.<br /><br />
            Having been there since graduating from college I had been given opportunities to grow and develop within the Human Resources team. I started as a relatively inexperienced HR systems administrator before moving into through HR consultant roles. I was then able to utilise my systems and technical skills to progress into technical HR roles covering HR Projects, which included number of acquisitions. This then evolved into a HR System and Management Information management role, which then lead into working in HR Reward (Remuneration).<br /><br />
            Whilst I had enjoyed my time in HR, the timing of my departure was fortuitous as I had started to consider a career change as I was missing the opportunity to develop new skills and experiences.<br /><br />
            I studied Architecture to degree level at University.
          </p>
          <h4>Future</h4>
          <p>I’m looking forward to what it may bring.
